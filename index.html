            My name is Ahmadjon or Ahmad, whichever is easier fro you. I am from  beautiful country Tajikistan.<br>
            I am fluent in Farsi and Russian, and there is why I love Russian poetry. You can find some poems of my<br>
            favorite poets of Russian classics Lermontov and Pushkin. Poems help me to concetrate during<br>
            stress period or final exams.

                    If I walk the noisy streets, <br>
                    Or enter a many thronged church, <br>
                    Or sit among the wild young generation, <br>
                    I give way to my thoughts. <br>

                    I say to myself: the years are fleeting, <br>
                    And however many there seem to be, <br>
                    We must all go under the eternal vault, <br>
                    And someone's hour is already at hand. <br>

                    When I look at a solitary oak <br>
                    I think: the patriarch of the woods. <br>
                    It will outlive my forgotten age <br>
                    As it outlived that of my grandfathers'. <br>

                    If I caress a young child, <br>
                    Immediately I think: farewell! <br>
                    I will yield my place to you, <br>
                    For I must fade while your flower blooms. <br>


                    Each day, every hour <br>
                    I habitually follow in my thoughts, <br>
                    Trying to guess from their number <br>
                    The year which brings my death. <br>


                    And where will fate send death to me? <br>
                    In battle, in my travels, or on the seas? <br>
                    Or will the neighbouring valley <br>
                    Receive my chilled ashes? <br>

                    And although to the senseless body <br>
                    It is indifferent wherever it rots, <br>
                    Yet close to my beloved countryside <br>
                    I still would prefer to rest. <br>


                    And let it be, beside the grave's vault <br>
                    That young life forever will be playing, <br>
                    And impartial, indifferent nature <br>
                    Eternally be shining in beauty. <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
