                        He has been born for hopes and for joys, <br>
                        For inspirations peaceful! -- But, a crazy, <br>
                        He early left the world of fairy tales and toys <br>
                        And threw his heart in a sea of high life, hazy. <br>
                        God did not saved him from the world at once! <br>
                        Thus a ripe fruit, which early had matured, <br>
                        Midst flowers it hangs, an orphan poor, <br>
                        And does not satisfy nor any test, nor eyes; <br>
                        The time of their bloom is one when he dies! <br>

                        A greedy worm is gnawing him through, <br>
                        And while the girlfriends, so sweet and gentle, <br>
                        Are swaying on a branch -- the early fruit <br>
                        Just pulls the own one -- until the winter enters! <br>
                        It's awful to be old, without a grayish tingle: <br>
                        He does not find the peers; in a crowd, <br>
                        He goes, leaving locked his soul proud  <br>
                        Just not a slave nor a king, with other people mingled,  <br>
                        And all that he there feels, he ever feels a single! <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
